# Tasks: Website Performance Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-performance-optimization`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-performance-optimization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Performance optimization is inherently testable through automated Lighthouse audits, so explicit test tasks are included.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

**Project Structure** (Go + Templ + Tailwind static site):

- Build scripts: `cmd/optimize-images/`, `cmd/generate-lqip/`
- Templates: `internal/views/*.templ`
- Static assets: `static/fonts/`, `static/css/`, `static/js/`, `static/images/`
- Generated output: `dist/`
- Infrastructure: `terraform/*.tf`
- Build automation: `Makefile`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Install tools and initialize performance optimization infrastructure

2. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (fonts + baseline) - **70% font reduction**
3. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (image optimization) - **60-85% page weight reduction**
4. üéØ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run Lighthouse, measure load times, verify 90+ scores
5. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 4**: User Story 3 (smooth images) - **CLS ‚â§0.1**
6. üéØ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test on real devices, verify smooth loading
7. **Deploy MVP**: At this point, you have fast initial loads + smooth images = huge UX improvement

**Expected Lighthouse Improvement at MVP Stage**:

- Performance (Mobile): 65 ‚Üí 90+ (+25 points)
- Performance (Desktop): 80 ‚Üí 95+ (+15 points)
- LCP: 4.5s ‚Üí 2.0s
- CLS: 0.3 ‚Üí 0.05

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- **Performance is testable** via Lighthouse CI - each user story has clear success metrics
- **Independent testing** means each user story can be validated without others being complete
- **Build-time optimization** means no runtime complexity or Lambda changes
- **Constitutional alignment** maintained throughout - simplicity, static-first, build-time only
- **Commit after each task** or logical group for easy rollback
- **Stop at checkpoints** to validate user story independently before proceeding
- **Tools are system-level** (brew install) not Go dependencies to maintain simplicity
