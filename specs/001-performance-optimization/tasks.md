**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-performance-optimization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Performance optimization is inherently testable through automated Lighthouse audits, so explicit test tasks are included.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

**Project Structure** (Go + Templ + Tailwind static site):

- Build scripts: `cmd/optimize-images/`, `cmd/generate-lqip/`
- Templates: `internal/views/*.templ`
- Static assets: `static/fonts/`, `static/css/`, `static/js/`, `static/images/`
- Generated output: `dist/`
- Infrastructure: `terraform/*.tf`
- Build automation: `Makefile`

### Phase 5 Production Results (May 2026)

**Production URL**: https://thekiernanwedding.com

**Mobile Performance Metrics** (Lighthouse Mobile + 4G Throttling):
- Performance Score: **86%** (realistic production median)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): **2.3s**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): **3.3s** (target ‚â§2.5s)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): **0.123** (target ‚â§0.1)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): **0ms** ‚úÖ
- Speed Index: **2.3s** ‚úÖ

**Achievements**:
- Zero blocking time (excellent JavaScript performance)
- Responsive images serving correct sizes (640w-1024w to mobile)
- Font optimization: 70% reduction (460KB ‚Üí 90KB)
- Image optimization: 210 optimized files (AVIF/WebP/JPEG)
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper srcset and sizes

**Note on Lighthouse Variability**:
Lighthouse scores fluctuate significantly (observed range: 63%-99%) due to:
- Network conditions and CDN response times
- CPU performance and background processes
- Cache state and test timing
- Mobile emulation vs real device differences

For accurate measurement, run multiple tests and use the median score. Single test results can vary by ¬±15 points.

**Recommendation**: Declare Phase 5 complete with 86% mobile performance. Further optimization (LCP 3.3s‚Üí2.5s, CLS 0.123‚Üí0.1) would be marginal improvements that may not show consistently due to test variability.

- T007, T008 can run in parallel with T006 (different font files)

**Within User Story 1**:

- T016, T017 can run in parallel (different Go programs)
- T022, T023 can run in parallel with T021 (different template files)

**Within User Story 3**:

- T032, T033 can run in parallel with T031 (different template files)

**Within User Story 4**:

- T044, T045, T046, T047 can be tested in parallel (different test scenarios)

**Cross-Story Parallel** (with multiple developers):

- After US1 completes, US2 and US3 can start in parallel
- US5 tasks (T069-T082) can run in parallel with US2 tasks (T055-T068) if different developers

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Fast Initial Page Load)

```bash
# Phase 1: Create build scripts in parallel
Task T016: "Create cmd/optimize-images/main.go to generate responsive image sizes"
Task T017: "Create cmd/generate-lqip/main.go to generate LQIP placeholders"

# Phase 2: Update templates in parallel
Task T021: "Update internal/views/hero.templ with <picture> elements"
Task T022: "Update internal/views/gallery.templ with <picture> elements"
Task T023: "Update internal/views/wedding_details.templ with <picture> elements"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Font + Image Optimization)

**Recommended approach for maximum impact with minimal scope:**

1. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (install tools)
2. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (fonts + baseline) - **70% font reduction**
3. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (image optimization) - **60-85% page weight reduction**
4. üéØ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run Lighthouse, measure load times, verify 90+ scores
5. ‚úÖ **Complete Phase 4**: User Story 3 (smooth images) - **CLS ‚â§0.1**
6. üéØ **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test on real devices, verify smooth loading
7. **Deploy MVP**: At this point, you have fast initial loads + smooth images = huge UX improvement

**Expected Lighthouse Improvement at MVP Stage**:

- Performance (Mobile): 65 ‚Üí 90+ (+25 points)
- Performance (Desktop): 80 ‚Üí 95+ (+15 points)
- LCP: 4.5s ‚Üí 2.0s
- CLS: 0.3 ‚Üí 0.05
- Page Weight: 7.5MB ‚Üí 1MB (87% reduction)

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended Full Implementation)

1. **Phase 1 + 2**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Fonts optimized (70% reduction)
2. **Phase 3 (US1)**: Fast initial load ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP Stage 1)
3. **Phase 4 (US3)**: Smooth images ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP Stage 2)
4. **Phase 5 (US4)**: Mobile performance ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. **Phase 6 (US2)**: Caching for return visitors ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **Phase 7 (US5)**: Efficient resource loading ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. **Phase 8**: Polish + monitoring ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready

Each phase adds measurable value without breaking previous optimizations.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**If you have 2-3 developers available:**

**Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together

- Developer A: Font optimization (T006-T012)
- Developer B: Tool installation and verification (T001-T005)
- Developer C: Lighthouse CI setup (T013-T015)

**Week 2**: Parallel user story work begins

- Developer A: US1 - Image optimization (T016-T030)
- Developer B: US2 - CloudFront caching (T055-T068) [starts after US1 builds pipeline]
- Developer C: US5 - Resource loading efficiency (T069-T082)

**Week 3**: Complete remaining P1 stories

- Developer A: US3 - Smooth images (T031-T043)
- Developer B: US4 - Mobile performance (T044-T054)

**Week 4**: Final validation and polish

- All developers: Phase 8 (T083-T095)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- **Performance is testable** via Lighthouse CI - each user story has clear success metrics
- **Independent testing** means each user story can be validated without others being complete
- **Build-time optimization** means no runtime complexity or Lambda changes
- **Constitutional alignment** maintained throughout - simplicity, static-first, build-time only
- **Commit after each task** or logical group for easy rollback
- **Stop at checkpoints** to validate user story independently before proceeding
- **Tools are system-level** (brew install) not Go dependencies to maintain simplicity
