# Feature Specification: Website Performance Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-performance-optimization`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Optimize performance, aiming for 100 lighthouse and page speed scores. This will mostly include image optimization and caching, but please think deeply about how to optimize the performance"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Fast Initial Page Load (Priority: P1)

Wedding guests visiting the website for the first time should see the page content and images load instantly without waiting or staring at blank screens.

**Why this priority**: First impressions matter. Slow initial loads frustrate users and may cause them to leave before getting important wedding information. This is the most critical metric affecting user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring load time from a fresh browser (no cache) on various network speeds (4G, 3G, cable) and verifying page becomes interactive and images display within target times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest visits the website for the first time on a 4G mobile connection, **When** they navigate to the homepage, **Then** the page becomes interactive within 2 seconds and all visible images load within 3 seconds
2. **Given** a guest visits the website for the first time on a cable connection, **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** the page becomes interactive within 1 second and all visible images load within 1.5 seconds
3. **Given** a guest on a slow 3G connection, **When** they visit the homepage, **Then** they see critical content (text, navigation) within 3 seconds even if images are still loading

### User Story 2 - Instant Navigation for Return Visitors (Priority: P2)

Guests who have previously visited the site should experience near-instant page loads when returning or navigating between pages.

**Why this priority**: Return visits are common as guests check details multiple times. Fast repeat visits reduce friction and improve overall satisfaction with the website experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the site, clearing tab but not cache, revisiting the site, and measuring load time to verify cached resources are being used effectively.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest has previously visited the website, **When** they return to the site within 30 days, **Then** the page loads in under 0.5 seconds using cached resources
2. **Given** a guest is browsing between different pages on the site, **When** they navigate to a new page, **Then** the navigation feels instant (under 0.3 seconds) with no visible loading delay
3. **Given** a guest returns after cached resources have expired, **When** the browser revalidates the cache, **Then** only modified resources are re-downloaded

---

### User Story 3 - Smooth Image Display (Priority: P1)

Guests viewing photos on the site should see images load progressively without layout shifts, blurry placeholder flashes, or jarring visual changes.

**Why this priority**: Images are central to a wedding website's appeal. Poor image loading creates a janky, unprofessional experience that diminishes the visual storytelling.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by observing image loading behavior on various connection speeds and verifying no layout shifts occur (measured by Cumulative Layout Shift metric).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest views a page with images, **When** the images load, **Then** no layout shifts occur (CLS score of 0.1 or better)
2. **Given** images are loading on a slower connection, **When** the initial load begins, **Then** guests see low-quality placeholder images that progressively enhance to full quality
3. **Given** a guest scrolls down the page, **When** images below the fold come into view, **Then** they load just-in-time without slowing down the initial page load

---

### User Story 4 - Optimal Mobile Performance (Priority: P1)

Guests accessing the site on mobile devices should experience fast, smooth performance without excessive data usage or battery drain.

**Why this priority**: Most wedding website traffic comes from mobile devices. Mobile users often have slower connections and limited data plans, making optimization critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested using mobile devices or emulators on throttled connections, measuring load times, data transfer, and performance metrics specific to mobile.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest on a mobile device with 4G connection, **When** they load the homepage, **Then** total data transferred is under 1MB for the initial load
2. **Given** a guest on mobile, **When** they view images, **Then** appropriately sized images are served based on their device screen size
3. **Given** a guest on a mobile device, **When** they interact with the page (scrolling, tapping), **Then** interactions feel responsive with no lag (60fps)

---

### User Story 5 - Efficient Resource Loading (Priority: P2)

The website should load only the resources needed for the current page, minimizing unnecessary downloads and processing.

**Why this priority**: Loading unnecessary resources wastes bandwidth and slows down the site. Efficient resource loading directly improves all performance metrics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by analyzing network traffic and JavaScript execution to verify only required resources are loaded for each page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a guest visits any page, **When** the page loads, **Then** no unused CSS or JavaScript is downloaded
2. **Given** a guest visits the homepage, **When** resources load, **Then** critical resources load first and non-critical resources are deferred
3. **Given** the browser supports modern formats, **When** images are requested, **Then** the most efficient format (WebP, AVIF) is served

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has JavaScript disabled? (Pages should still load and display content)
- How does the system handle very slow connections (2G)? (Critical content loads first, images load progressively)
- What happens when CDN or S3 is temporarily unavailable? (Graceful degradation with appropriate error handling)
- How does the site perform on older mobile devices with limited processing power? (Minimal JavaScript execution, optimized rendering)
- What happens when a user navigates away before resources finish loading? (In-progress requests are cancelled to save bandwidth)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Image Optimization

- **FR-001**: System MUST serve images in modern, efficient formats (WebP with JPEG fallback as minimum, AVIF when browser supports it)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide multiple image sizes and serve appropriately sized images based on device viewport and pixel density
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement lazy loading for images below the fold to defer loading until needed
- **FR-004**: System MUST use proper image dimensions in HTML to prevent layout shifts during loading
- **FR-005**: System MUST compress images to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable visual quality (target 80-85% quality for photos)
- **FR-006**: Images MUST include low-quality placeholder images (LQIP) or blur-up effects for progressive loading experience

#### Caching Strategy

- **FR-007**: System MUST implement aggressive browser caching for static assets with cache lifetime of at least 1 year for versioned resources
- **FR-008**: System MUST use cache-busting techniques (filename hashing or query parameters) to enable long-term caching while allowing updates

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Assumptions

- Target audience primarily accesses the site from mobile devices (60%+ mobile traffic expected)
- Most users will visit the site 2-4 times to check wedding details
- Average connection speed for mobile users is 4G or better
- CDN (CloudFront) is already configured and available for use
- S3 bucket serving static assets supports custom headers and compression
- Modern browsers (last 2 versions) represent 95%+ of traffic
- Site content (images, text) does not change frequently after initial launch

### Constraints

- Must maintain current architecture (static HTML from S3, API routes via Lambda)
- Must work within existing AWS infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, Lambda)
- Cannot introduce new paid services without justification
- Must maintain visual quality of images (no overly aggressive compression)
- Must remain compatible with existing build process (make commands)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Current Tailwind CSS build process must support purging unused CSS
- Templ template system must support inlining critical CSS
- Build pipeline must support image optimization and format conversion
- Static site generation must support generating multiple image sizes

### External Dependencies

- CloudFront distribution configuration may need updates for optimal caching headers
- S3 bucket may need configuration changes for compression and cache headers
- NPM packages for image optimization may need to be added to build process

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this feature:

- Migrating to a different hosting platform or architecture
- Adding server-side rendering (SSR) or moving away from static site approach
- Implementing Service Workers or Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Adding sophisticated client-side routing or single-page application (SPA) functionality
- Optimizing Lambda function performance (out of scope since Lambda only handles API routes, not page loads)
- Redesigning the visual layout or content structure
- Adding real-time features or WebSocket connections

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Image Quality Degradation

**Description**: Aggressive optimization may reduce image quality below acceptable levels for a wedding website where visual appeal is important.

**Mitigation**: Establish quality baselines using sample images before bulk optimization. Use visual comparison tools. Maintain original images and make optimization process reversible.

### Risk: Build Process Complexity

**Description**: Adding image optimization and asset processing may significantly slow down build times or complicate the development workflow.

**Mitigation**: Implement incremental/cached image optimization so only changed images are reprocessed. Consider separating optimization into production-only build step.

### Risk: Browser Compatibility

**Description**: Modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) or aggressive optimization techniques may not work on older browsers.

**Mitigation**: Implement proper fallbacks for older browsers. Test on target browser matrix. Use progressive enhancement approach.

### Risk: Cache Invalidation Issues

**Description**: Aggressive caching may prevent users from seeing updates when content changes.

**Mitigation**: Implement robust cache-busting strategy using content hashing. Test cache invalidation process. Document process for forcing cache refresh when needed.
